General Project Documentation
Maxwell Wang submission for FBLA Nationals 2017-18, Coding and Programming

DESCRIPTION: 
Manages members, fines, and inventory for a school library.
Programmed in Eclipse WindowBuilder with Java Swing, Runs in JRE 7 / version 1.7.0_80 (Java 7)

INSTALLATION:
To run, download the Runnable JAR file, FBLACodingSubmissionMW.jar. This file will most likely end up in the downloads folder, and so will TSHSLibrarydata.ser (unless you move the .jar before running it). For more secure purposes, the jar file can be moved to another folder.
The application will create a text file: Do not delete the TSHSLibrarydata.ser file, or the data stored in the database will be reset. Do not modify its filepath. 
A backup way to run is to download the project classes to an IDE like Eclipse/IntelliJ, and run the class TSHSLibrary.java, and the program should appear. All necessary files are included in the repository. 
Text documents show specifications and additional notes about developing the application.

USAGE:
The program has 5 separate tabs: Books, Members, Report, Help, and Settings.


The settings tab displays information about library presets, such as the amount of fines accumulated for overdue books, and maximum alloted books for each student or teacher.
For additional help, refer to the help tab in the application.

Requirements and Guidelines:

Coding & Programming Category: Prejudged Projects & Presentation Type: Individual Overview Two (2) parts: a prejudged project and a presentation. Competitors must complete both parts for award eligibility.

Topic: Develop a database program to manage the issuance of books at a school library. Give the school a name. The program must be able to complete a minimum of the following tasks: 
Track student and teacher names with ability to enter/view/edit names. 
Track the issuance of books for a student or teacher. 
Manage different limits for the number of books that can be issued to a student or teacher. 
Manage the number of days that students and teachers can check out any book. (Hint: Mostly like the number of days will differ for students and teachers). 
Give each book a different ID. Also, each book of same name and same author (but number of copies) will have different ID. 
Generate/print weekly report to show books issued to whom and number of days leading to the due date return. 
Generate/print weekly report of detail of fines (when book not returned on time).

Specific Guidelines 
The program must run on Windows XP or higher. Solution must run standalone with no programming errors. Data must be free of viruses/malware. Any entry with contaminated data will not be judged. The program should be shown to the judges.
