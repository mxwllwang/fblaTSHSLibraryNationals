# fblaTSHSLibraryNationals
Maxwell Wang submission for FBLA Nationals 2017-18, Coding and Programming
Programmed in Eclipse WindowBuilder with Java Swing, Runs in JRE 7 / version 1.7.0_80 (Java 7)

To run, download the Runnable JAR file, FBLACodingAndProgrammingSubmissionMW.jar. This file will likely end up in the downloads folder, and so will TSHSLibrarydata.ser (unless you move the .jar before running it) The application will create a text file: Do not delete the TSHSLibrarydata.ser file, or the data stored in the database will be reset. Do not modify its filepath. Another backup way to run is to download the project classes to an IDE like Eclipse/IntelliJ, and run the class TSHSLibrary.java, and the program should appear. All files are included. Text documents show notes about developing the application.
